# Puzzle Dataset

This repository contains the images of the 3 commonly-used datasets in the domain of Puzzle reconstruction: The Cho[1], BGU[2], and McGill[3]

Since there is no official page to download these image, I made this repository to prevent the vanishing of these images. All the credits belongs to the creators of these dataset.
